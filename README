Simple PoC with replace local stack with MMX/SSE registers. This example contain C and ASM implementation of the same function. This function is main SHA512 hash function internals with calculate next part of data and accumulate it into structures.

On my machine with CPU i7-4790 I got from few up to 15-16% speed with ASM code faster then C code.
